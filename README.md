## Abstract
With the development of cloud storage and privacy protection, reversible data hiding in encrypted images (RDHEI) has attracted increasing attention as a technology that can: embed additional data in the image encryption domain, ensure that the embedded data can be extracted error-free, and the original image can be restored losslessly. In this paper, a high-capacity RDHEI algorithm based on multi-MSB (most significant bit) prediction and Huffman coding is proposed. At first, multi-MSB of each pixel was predicted adaptively and marked by Huffman coding in the original image. Then, the image was encrypted by a stream cipher method. At last, the vacated space can be used to embed additional data by multi-MSB substitution. Experimental results show that our method achieved higher embedding capacity while comparing with the state-of-the-art methods.

## 摘要
随着云存储和隐私保护的发展，隐藏在加密图像中的可逆数据(RDHEI)作为一种可以:在图像加密域中嵌入额外的数据，确保嵌入的数据能够被无错误地提取，并且能够无损地恢复原始图像的技术越来越受到人们的关注。本文提出了一种基于多msb (most significant bit)预测和霍夫曼编码的大容量RDHEI算法。首先对原始图像中每个像素点的多msb进行自适应预测，并用霍夫曼编码进行标记。然后采用流密码方法对图像进行加密。最后，通过多msb替换，利用空出的空间嵌入额外的数据。实验结果表明，与现有的方法相比，我们的方法实现了更高的嵌入容量。
